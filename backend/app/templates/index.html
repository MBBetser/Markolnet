            This website is a local marketplace where neighbors can sell excess produce they can't use before it spoils. 
            Whether overbought or due to travel plans, users can quickly list items at low prices, reducing food waste and providing affordable options for others nearby. 
            Itâ€™s a simple way to save money and build a stronger community through resource-sharing.
